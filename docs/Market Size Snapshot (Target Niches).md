# **Market Size Snapshot (Target Niches)**

**Note:** These are directional ranges. Market sizing varies by analyst definitions and scope.

## **1\) GPU Hardware-as-a-Service (direct TAM)**

* **\~$5.8B–$8.2B (2025)**  
* Projected to **\~$26B–$27B (2030)**  
* Some longer-term forecasts go higher (e.g., **\~$49.8B by 2032**)

**Relevance:** This is the closest proxy to your MVP: *dedicated GPU nodes sold as a service.*

---

## **2\) Enterprise Document AI (IDP: OCR → extraction)**

* Estimate A: **$2.30B (2024) → $12.35B (2030)**  
* Estimate B (broader definition): **$10.57B (2025) → $66.68B (2032)**

**Relevance:** High batch volume \+ privacy constraints → good fit for dedicated nodes and BYO pipelines.

---

## **3\) “RAG factories” \+ Vector Databases**

### **RAG market**

* **$1.2B (2024) → \~$11.0B (2030)**

### **Vector database market**

* **$2.05B (2024) → \~$7.34B (2030)**

**Relevance:** Embedding \+ indexing creates repeatable compute demand; “managed vector DB” is a natural upsell later.

---

## **4\) Internal Copilots / Code Tools (proxy for private copilot demand)**

* Estimate A: **$4.86B (2023) → \~$26.03B (2030)**  
* Estimate B: **$7.37B (2025) → \~$23.97B (2030)**

**Relevance:** Strong “keep code private” demand → dedicated inference nodes \+ indexing workloads.

---

## **5\) LLM \+ ModelOps (broader context for fine-tune/eval/serving)**

### **LLM market**

* **$5.62B (2024) → \~$35.43B (2030)**

### **ModelOps market**

* **$5.64B (2024) → \~$43.60B (2030)**

**Relevance:** Even if customers don’t fine-tune constantly, they do eval, batch inference, and internal deployments (recurring GPU usage).

---

## **Quick takeaway for MVP**

For **dedicated GPU nodes \+ concierge**, the strongest “directly monetizable” demand signals come from:

* **GPUaaS spend** (direct category you compete in)  
* **Document AI** (batch \+ privacy)  
* **RAG/vector** (continuous indexing)  
* **Private copilots** (internal inference)
